## **Projects**

Some of the project documentation for:

    A custom Docker image for the Caddy web server that includes the CrowdSec bouncer for IP blocking and a Web Application Firewall (WAF).

    This script automates the initial setup and security hardening of a fresh Debian or Ubuntu server.

* ### [**docker-registry-notifier**](./docker-registry-notifier/getting-started.md)
    A lightweight, multi-architecture webhook receiver to get notifications from your private Docker Registry.

* ### [**headscale-cloudflare-dnssync**](./headscale-cloudflare-dnssync/getting-started.md)
    This is a fork of [marc1307/tailscale-cloudflare-dnssync](https://github.com/marc1307/tailscale-cloudflare-dnssync).
    This version includes fixes for error reporting bugs encountered during API communication (ensuring clearer diagnostic messages) and has been tested with Headscale v0.25.1 & v0.26.x.
